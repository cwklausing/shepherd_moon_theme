Shepherd Moon Theme
===================

This is a simple Wordpress theme built for my friend's farm website. To install the theme...

- Drag the theme into your site's themes folder
- From your preferred CLI, navigate into the theme, then run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies for the project.
- Before beginning to make scss changes to the project, run the task `grunt watch` to compile your changes.

### Plugins Used

- ACF Pro
- Custom Post Type UI
- WPForms Lite

Note: To use this theme, you will need a json file of the ACF fields (or you could go through theme files and recreate them by hand, but that seems tedious). Feel free to email me if you'd like to use the theme and I'd be happy to send it your way.
